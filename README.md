# Devops Examples Using Docker and Nginx

Devops typically involves many tools and applications (e.g., version control, CI/CD applications, containerization, monitoring, ...etc.).
Consider this a "sandbox" where we experiment with some typical "devops tasks" but limit our
environment to the following:
- Docker Containers
- Nginx
- A Sample Applications (Flask API in this case)

These examples assume that you have Docker installed.

- `1_scaling_flask_api` - Scale Up / Scale Down
- `2_blue_green_flask_api` - Blue / Green Deployments
